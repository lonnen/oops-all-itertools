==================
Oops All Itertools
==================

Python's ``more-itertools`` is a fantastic compliment to ``itertools`` but it's
inconvenient to have to constantly look up which itertool is in which library.
Oops All Itertools heaps them together into a loose pile in a single namespace.

Inspired by `more-itertools issue 681 <https://github.com/more-itertools/more-itertools/issues/681>`_
